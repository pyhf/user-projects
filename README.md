# `pyhf` User Projects

An incomplete list of projects where people are using `pyhf`.

As it isn't reasonable for the `pyhf` dev team to expect that everyone who uses `pyhf` will interact on the `pyhf` GitHub, requesting features, and possibly making contributions, keeping track of projects and what other people build to use `pyhf` can be informative for future development.
